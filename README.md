### Made in KiCad


I provide only KiCad files because different PCB fabs require different export methods
Just google "[your preffered pcb fab] KiCad guide"


This mod is tested and needs some hacking around to work properly.
For example some of dl380p g8 fan revisions have thinner ears on the connectors so for those you need to have thinner pcbs (6mm ones from jlcpcb work).
To have the connector that goes into the motherboard make proper contact 80% of the time instead of 30% you need to solder it on at an angle (will add pics soon).
